# This file includes the abbreviations used to make the language data files smaller (and load a bit faster)
# The basic structure is as follows:
#   nameOfXMLTag : Abbr
# Lines beginning with an octatherp are ignored.
# Characters need only be unique within their domain - that is, while C is the abbreviation for
# the top level characters, it may ALSO be the abbreviation for calendars, because they will never
# be confused for each other.  Tags are case insensitive, but before making any changes here, ensure
# cohesion between this file and the indicated files.  These are currently NOT used in code, but should
# be updated in case it becomes feasible to automatically insert them into code
